## Installation



## Dataset Download

Please download our dataset from the [project website](http://thermal.cs.uni-freiburg.de/) and extract it somewhere on 
your hard drive. Please download the training and validation data and extract them into separate folders.

## Usage

In the following, we describe how to use the code for training and evaluating the Heatnet model.

### Model Training

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/main.py --data <path_to_training_data> --valdata <path_to_validation_data>
```


### Model Evaluation
 

```bash
python scripts/main.py --data <path_to_training_data> --valdata <path_to_validation_data> --resume <path_to_model> --evaluate
```


### Configuration

Model architecture definitions, training parameters, and other settings can be found in the `heatnet_conf.json` file.
